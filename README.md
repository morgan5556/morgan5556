### Morgan
I'm a sixth form student from England who studies Computer Science at A-Level. From September, I am hoping to study Computer Science at university.

For my A-Level, I am using Visual Basic. My most favourite project that I have built was for my Computer Science coursework. For this, I built a quiz platform in Visual Basic which involved SQL and network programming. 

**Programming Information:**
* Languages:                  Visual Basic, Python, SQL
* I'm currently learning:     Python (re-learning)
* I'm currently working on:   MorganBot (Discord Bot)

**Where to find me:**
* Discord: morgan5556#3969
* Twitter: morgan_5556
